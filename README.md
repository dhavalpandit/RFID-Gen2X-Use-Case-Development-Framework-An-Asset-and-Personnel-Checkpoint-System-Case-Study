# RFID-Gen2X-Use-Case-Development-Framework-An-Asset-and-Personnel-Checkpoint-System-Case-Study
The RFID (Gen2X) Use Case Development Framework enables real-time asset and personnel checkpoint tracking with &lt;250ms latency. It integrates RFID readers, antennas, and UHF tags with Python + Streamlit dashboards, Flask APIs, and optional OpenCV validation to deliver secure, scalable, and edge-friendly automation.


# 📡 RFID (Gen2X) Use Case Development Framework  
*An Asset and Personnel Checkpoint System Case Study*  

## 📌 Overview  
The **RFID (Gen2X) Use Case Development Framework** demonstrates how **RFID readers, antennas, and passive UHF tags** can be applied to real-world checkpoint systems for both **personnel identification** and **asset tracking**.  
This case study highlights a research-driven system built with **Python and Streamlit**, designed for **real-time automation, edge-friendly deployment, and high accuracy**.
